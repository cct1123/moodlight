## idea
I was watching a MV someday, that MV is "odd eye" from dreamcatcher (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QD0FeZyDtQ). 
The sceneries are pretty gorgeous and dynamic to me. Then I had the idea to project the moodlight of the MV to the whole room 
such that the indoor lighting gets the same vibe as the video!! This will definitely boost the visual enjoyment to the next level.
So I started this project which is to extract the mood colors of any images, videos and monitor screens in real-time. 
Eventually, I can input the color data to the indoor lighting system to synchronize the mood. (this will be another project)

## search
I found a similar project, but it extracts colors based on the histogram. (https://github.com/obskyr/colorgram.py)
An image can contain backgrounds, objects, people, logos etc. The colorgram.py would wrongly extract the dominated color
instead of the background color (which determines the mood and style).

Another project on github also exists a similar problem.(https://github.com/rainyear/ImageColorTheme)
